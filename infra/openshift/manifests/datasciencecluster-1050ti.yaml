  components:
    # Core Components - Essential for nanabush/glooscap workflows
    workbenches:
      managementState: Managed
      # Jupyter workbenches for model development and testing
      # Used by data scientists to develop/test translation models
    
    dashboard:
      managementState: Managed
      # RHOAI Dashboard UI for managing workbenches and models
      # Essential for easy management of AI/ML workloads
    
    # Model Serving - Critical for vLLM integration (nanabush)
    kserve:
      managementState: Managed
      # KServe for model serving - will handle vLLM inference endpoints
      # GPU support via NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NIM)

    # Job Management
    kueue:
      managementState: Managed
      # Kubernetes-native job queue for ML workloads
      # Manages translation job queues (glooscap integration)
    
    # Optional but useful for explainability
    trustyai:
      managementState: Managed
      # TrustyAI for model explainability and bias detection
      # Useful for translation model validation
    
    # Resource-intensive components - Disabled for single-node cluster
    datasciencepipelines:
      managementState: Removed
      # Kubeflow Pipelines - too resource-intensive for 1050Ti
      # Can enable later if needed for complex workflows
    
    trainingoperator:
      managementState: Removed
      # Training Operator - limited benefit on single-node
      # Distributed training needs multiple nodes
    
    codeflare:
      managementState: Removed
      # CodeFlare - not needed for single-node cluster
    
    ray:
      managementState: Removed
      # Ray framework - optional, skip for minimal setup
      # Can enable later if needed for parallel processing
    
    modelmeshserving:
      managementState: Removed
